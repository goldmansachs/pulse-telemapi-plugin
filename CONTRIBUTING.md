3. Respond to any question or suggestions raised in the issue by other developers.
4. Fork the project repository and prepare your proposed contribution.

## Pull Request
- Create separate PRs for each issue/bug/feature.
- Squash your commits down to a few commits, or one commit, before submitting a pull request.
